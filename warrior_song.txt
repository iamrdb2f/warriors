Lyrics
The devil whispered:
"You cannot withstand the storm"
The warrior replied:
"I am the storm"
You are a warrior
You will get through the storm
You will show the storm who's boss
You will show everyone you are stronger than all things that have hurt you
You are stronger than your past
You are stronger than the challenges coming in your future
You will tell yourself:
"I don't invite life's challenges but I don't back down from them either"
I know we all face tough times
I know I am not exempt from life's struggles
But I know I am strong
I know this will pass
I know there will be better days
But only if I keep fighting
Like a warrior
Fighting with all my heart
The heart of a lion
The strength I have is like no other
I am not a survivor
I am a warrior
I don't survive
I thrive
I can do this and I will get through this
Warriors are built from the struggle, formed from pain, strengthened by adversity
Embrace your challenges and push through them like the warrior you are
You are stronger than your past
And you are stronger than the challenges coming in your future
The strength I have is like no other
I am not a survivor
I am a warrior
I don't survive
I thrive
I can do this and I will get through this
I make the best of bad situations
I see the opportunity in the struggle
I grow strength from my hardships
I am thankful for my hard times, they make me stronger
I am thankful for the pain, it makes me raise my game
I am grateful for the worst of times, it ensures my story will be a great one
From zero to hero
From nothing to something
From the bottom to the top
Here I come
